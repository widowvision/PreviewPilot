tentatively adding link to feedback; my partner said she'd have it done by midnight 
but i'm adding our drive link with a hard copy of what's done so far in case. I will update if she adds her feedback before i fall asleep

  Communications esp with client, powerpoint, google news API, wireframes
  
  Jiaqi seems to be doing a good job keeping up with client communications. Her powerpoint especially was impressive to me and it seems like she is very knowledgeable on her project’s goal. Her contributions to the wireframe seemed robust as well. I think it would be a good idea for her to make sure she can continue the progress that she’s making. A point of improvement might be to dive deeper on google news API usage, although I do think she’s making good use of it considering they only have access to the free version
