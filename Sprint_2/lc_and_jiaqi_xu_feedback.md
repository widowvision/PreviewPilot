    Jiaqi Xu

Communications esp with client, powerpoint, google news API, wireframes

Jiaqi seems to be doing a good job keeping up with client communications. Her powerpoint especially was impressive to me and it seems like she is very knowledgeable on her project’s goal. Her contributions to the wireframe seemed robust as well. I think it would be a good idea for her to make sure she can continue the progress that she’s making. A point of improvement might be to dive deeper on google news API usage, although I do think she’s making good use of it considering they only have access to the free version

LC has clear objectives for the execution of the Project and has executed her team responsibilities with great clarity and diligence. She has not only established detailed meeting records for the team's client meetings but has also taken charge of the project's database. Currently, she is exploring solutions to the library issues within the Project and has been actively investigating how to convert 2D images into 3D effects – a core challenge of the project. LC has undertaken indispensable roles within the project, establishing external connections, laying the groundwork for the project, and exploring core technical issues. LC's performance has been outstanding.
